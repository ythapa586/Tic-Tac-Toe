# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java Swing and AWT.
This project provides a fun way to learn about GUI programming, event handling, and basic game logic in Java.

The game starts with Player X.
-Players take turns clicking on empty tiles.
-After each move:
-The game checks for a winning combination (3 same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal).
-If no winner and the board is full, it declares a tie.
-The top label displays the current playerâ€™s turn or the final result.
